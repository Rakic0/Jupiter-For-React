   ```

3. **Install the dependencies:**

   ```shell
   npm install
   ```

4. **Start the development server:**

   ```shell
   npm start
   ```

   This will start the development server and open the Jupiter Clone in your default browser.

   > Note: Ensure you have Node.js installed on your machine before running the above commands.

5. **Access the Jupiter Clone:**

   Once the development server is running, you can access the Jupiter Clone by navigating to http://localhost:3000 in your web browser.

   > Note: You may need to wait a few moments for the development server to compile and launch the application.

6. **Start exploring the Jupiter Clone:**

   You can now start exploring the Jupiter Clone's interactive notebook interface. Create new code cells, write and execute code, and view the output in real-time. Enjoy!

## Usage

Once the development server is running, you can start using the Jupiter Clone. Create new code cells by clicking the `Code` button or `Text`.

Write your code in the code cells, and wait for code execution. The output will be displayed on the right side of the cell.

You can also make a Markdown cell. This allows you to add text explanations, documentation, or formatted content to your notebook.

Integrated `show(params)` function is used to display content.
You can use it with this params: string, number, object, array, JSX element, React Component.
