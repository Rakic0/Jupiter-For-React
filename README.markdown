## Features

- Interactive notebook interface with code cells
- Support for Javascript and React
- Execute code cells and view the output in real-time
- Markdown support for adding explanations and documentation
- Easily displaying content on screen using integrated function
- Caching imports and optimized bundling

## Installation

To run the Jupyter Clone locally, you need to have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) installed on your machine. Follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```shell
   git clone https://github.com/Rakic0/Jupyter-For-React
   ```

2. **Navigate to the project directory:**

   ```shell
   cd Jupyter-For-React
   ```

3. **Install the dependencies:**

   ```shell
   npm install
   ```

4. **Start the development server:**

   ```shell
   npm start
   ```

   This will start the development server and open the Jupyter Clone in your default browser.

   > Note: Ensure you have Node.js installed on your machine before running the above commands.

5. **Access the Jupyter Clone:**

   Once the development server is running, you can access the Jupyter Clone by navigating to http://localhost:3000 in your web browser.

   > Note: You may need to wait a few moments for the development server to compile and launch the application.

6. **Start exploring the Jupyter Clone:**

   You can now start exploring Jupyter Clone's interactive notebook interface. Create new code cells, write and execute code, and view the output in real time. Enjoy!

## Usage

Once the development server is running, you can start using the Jupyter Clone. Create new code cells by clicking the `Code` button or `Text`.

Write your code in the code cells, and wait for code execution. The output will be displayed on the right side of the cell.

You can also make a Markdown cell. This allows you to add text explanations, documentation, or formatted content to your notebook.

Integrated `show(params)` function is used to display content.
You can use it with these params: string, number, object, array, JSX element, React Component.
